# Live Form updates (Task submission for the Inter-IIT IBP Project)

This is my submission for the Inter-IIT score-board IBP project.

## Tech Stack

The Tech stack that I have used for this project is:

- React (Typescript) for the front-end.
- NodeJS (Express + socket.io) for the back-end.
- Firebase Firestore for the databasing.

## Running this app

### 1. Installing NodeJS and Yarn

If you have already installed NodeJS and Yarn you can skip this section and move on to the next step.

#### Installing NodeJS

1. To install NodeJS, head on to the official [NodeJS site](https://NodeJS.org/en) and install the `18.18.0` version for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen
3. Once NodeJS is installed, you can verify that it is working by opening a terminal and running the following command:

```
node -v
```

This should print the version of NodeJS running on your system.

**Please note that the following command should also run:**

```
npm -v
```

#### Installing Yarn

Once NodeJS is installed, you can proceed to install yarn. You can do that by running the following command:

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Once installed, you can check the installation by running:

```
yarn --version
```
